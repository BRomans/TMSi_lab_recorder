# TMSi Lab Recorder
This repository contains an .xml OpenVibe template and a simple Matlab script to record experimental tasks with a TMSi Porti BCI system.
During the testing and setup of the device the Matlab script was used, but for the final experiment only the OpenVibe scene was used for ease of use and recovery in case the computational resources used exceeded the capability of the device used.
The OpenVibe scene generates a .csv file and an equivalent .ov file. An example of a .csv dataset recorded on my self is available in the folder open-vibe/recordings/michele/ and it has already been cleared out of 0-value channels.
